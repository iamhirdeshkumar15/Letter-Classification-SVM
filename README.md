# Letter-Classification-SVM
This project implements letter classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) in R. It utilizes two kernel methods: vanilladot (linear) and rbfdot (RBF) to predict letters from the letterdata.csv dataset. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of classification accuracy for each kernel.
